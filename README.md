# python-fun
Python projects, games and exercises I've made.

## photo

Photography oriented python scripts for art making and utility.

## games

Typical beginner python scripts. Added some neat little features.

words-final.py needs /usr/share/dict/words file to work.
This one still had some slight bugs.

These games can be run using 'python3 <filename>' in your terminal while in the file directory.
